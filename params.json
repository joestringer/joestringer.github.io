{"name":"Joe Stringer","tagline":"","body":"### Profile\r\n\r\nI'm a recent graduate of the University of Waikato in Hamilton, New Zealand. The focus of my degree was in Computer Science with a specialisation in Networks. For the Honours component of my degree, I worked on OpenFlow 1.1+ support in Open vSwitch. At the end of this project, my work was recognised with first class honours.\r\n\r\nMy ongoing contributions to Open Source include:\r\n* [Arch Linux](http://archlinux.org) - Assistance with the Wiki and PKGBUILDs\r\n* [RouteFlow](http://cpqd.github.io/RouteFlow) - Development on extensibility and use with OpenFlow hardware\r\n* [Open vSwitch](http://openvswitch.org) - OpenFlow-1.1+ feature implementation\r\n\r\nYou'll find me hanging around FOSS mailing lists, Hacker News and Slashdot. In my spare time, I enjoy listening to music and jamming on my drum kit.
